Howdy folx.

I am a trained hobbyist in many things Unix. Currently an incredibly novice programmer, mediocre problem solver, and avid learner.

Checkout my website (which is very sparse), email me (or don't), and checkout my work (it's not that great).

Most of my involvement puts me near the [KISS-Community](https://github.com/kiss-community), as a sort of lead maintainer and breaker of all things related to the community aspects of KISS Linux (strictly unaffiliated from the official upstream, please don't bother Dylan).

Basically every thing you find here is an accident.

Have fun.
